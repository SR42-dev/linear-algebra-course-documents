gauss jordan method :

- take [A:I]
- perform row transforms to get [U:C] (L^-1)

- transform U further to get I :

	- use the bottom rows to make the elements above them zero by subtracting
	- get a diagonal matrix using these transforms
	- Use Ri -> kRi transform to reduce diagonal elements to 1s
	
- the transformed C will be A^-1

- A matrix A is invertible only if the product of the pivot elements in U form is not equal to zero

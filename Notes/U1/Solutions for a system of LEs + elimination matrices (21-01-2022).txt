Types of solutions for a system of LEs :

- trivial solution : x = y = z = 0
- unique/non-trivial solution
- infinite solutions : express solutions as functions of k
- no solutions 

elimination matrix / elementary matrix (l) :

- a matrix which when multiplied with A yields it's echelon form
- obtained from identity matrix by row transformation of Ri -> Ri - lij*Rj
- i.e.; I -> Eij

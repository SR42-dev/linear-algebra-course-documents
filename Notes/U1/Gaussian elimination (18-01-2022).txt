general steps :

- express equations as matrices (Ax = b form)
- express as [A:b] augmented form
- perform row operations to convert matrix to a form where pivots = 1 & elements below pivots become 0 (echelon form)
- write down number of unknowns (n) & ranks of A (after transforms) & A:b (after transforms)
- rank of a matrix is the number of non zero rows in it's row echelon form

- if rank(A) = rank(A:b) < n : infinite solutions
- if rank(A) = rank(A:b) = n : unique solution -> back substitute using transformed matrices
- if rank(A) = rank(A:b) > n : impossible
- if rank(A) != rank(A:b) : inconsistent

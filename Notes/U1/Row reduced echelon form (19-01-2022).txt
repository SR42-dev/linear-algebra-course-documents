general steps :

- convert matrix to echelon form
- divide each row by it's pivot element
- identify the last row having a pivot equal to 1, and let this be the pivot row
- add multiples of the pivot row to each of the upper rows, until every element above the pivot equals 0
- moving up the matrix, repeat this process for each row

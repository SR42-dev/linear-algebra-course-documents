introduction :

- systems of linear equations
- linear mappings between vector spaces
- geometry of n dimensional space & it's linear transformations

- topics :
	- matrices & gaussian elimination
	- vector spaces
	- linear transforms & orthogonality
	- orthogonalization, eigen values & eigen vectors
	- singular value decomposition

- system of linear equations matrix notation
	- coefficient matrix * vector of unknowns = vector of constants

- augmented matrix

- solutions to a system of linear equations :
	- consistent : unique or infinite solutions
	- inconsistent : no solution

- elementary transformations :
	- Ri -> Rj
	- Ri -> kRj
	- Ri -> Ri + kRj

- echelon form of a matrix (obtained by transforms):
	- first non zero element in row is pivot
	- below each pivot is a column of zeros from elementary ops
	- each pivot lies to the right of the above row pivot
	- zero rows at bottom only

- row reduced echelon form
	- every row in echelon form must be divided by it's pivot
	- entry above first non zero pivot must be zero (get using transforms)

- equivalent matrices
	- matrices that can equate to each other with transformations

- row & column picture
- The singular cases

steps to get elementary matrices of A :

- convert A to upper echelon form (U)
- record the transforms required to do so
- perform the same transforms on unit matrices (one for one)
- each transformation on a unit matrix yields an elementary matrix

general :

- if it takes n transformations on A to get U, then applying each transform on an individual unit matrix yields an elementary matrix
- therefore, n transforms yield n elementary matrices (E)
- if inversed and multiplied with U, Es can yield og matrix A

triangular factorization :

- A can be factored as A = LU
- L is a lower triangular matrix (lower echelon form)
- L is the product of inverted Es of A
- L is also the inverted product of Es of A
- factorization not possible when a pivot value becomes 0

LDU factorization :

- A can also be expressed as LDU :

	- L : lower triangular matrix with 1s on diagonal
	- U : upper triangular matrix with 1s on diagonal
	- D : diagonal matrix

- to factorize U into DU :

	- divide each row of U by it's pivot
	- then D is the diagonal of pivots and the new U gives DU
	- L is obtained as usual in LU factorization

permutation matrices :

- matrices obtained from A by row exchange are permutation matrices of A
- when a row exchange is performed on A and I, the new I*A gives the original A
- an nxn matrix has n! permutations and hence n! permutation matrices
- when a matrix isn't factorizable, multiply it with a permutation where the referenced pivot element is 0 and then factorize

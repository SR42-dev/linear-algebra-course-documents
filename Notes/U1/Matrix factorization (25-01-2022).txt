PA/LU factorization :

- method 1 :

	- convert A to U by row transforms
	- apply same transforms to I to get P
	- let PA = C
	- factorize C to LU

- method 2 :

	- when converting A to U, if elimination fails (a pivot becomes zero), then P is only the last row transform applied on I
	- factorize PA into LU form

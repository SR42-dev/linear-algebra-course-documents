general :

- in the system Ax = b, if b is null, find null space of A, else column space of A
- column space in a vector space containing (x1, y1, z1) & (x2, y2, z2)	is a 2D plane passing through those two points
- if b exists in the column space of A, then the system is solvable (linear combination of LHS vectors)
- N(A) : zero vector in A
- column space can also be one of the axes if one of the coordinates are zero

- <definition of column, null & solution spaces>
- <examples>

- null space/column space is the solution of the system Ax = b given b is/isn't null matrix

- If the rank of a square matrix is equal to it's side, then it's column space is the entire vector space
- column space can be defined as a line/plane/space passing through the pivot columns of A

- special solution : null space

finding the complete solution for a system of equations :

- Xcomplete = Xparticular + Xnullspace; in Ax = b

- bring system to Rx = d form
- Xparticular can be found by setting free variables to zero in pv(fv)
- Xnullspace can be found by solving for Ax = 0

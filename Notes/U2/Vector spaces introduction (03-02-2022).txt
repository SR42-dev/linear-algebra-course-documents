general :

- assume a system of LAs Ax = b
- to bring b to left hand side vector form, vector spaces are required
- this is an alternative to inversion as non swuare matrices can't be inverted

- for an R^2 to be a vector space, 3 (and by extension 10) axioms have to be fulfilled :

	- vectors u + v = w E R^2 where u E R^2 & v E R^2
	- u + v = v + u; commutativity
	- null vector E R^2
	
	- u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w
	- u + 0 = u
	- u + (-u) = 0
	- cu = w E R^2
	- c(u + w) = cu + cv
	- (c + d)u = cu + du
	- 1.u = u

- vector space R^2 is 2 dimensional, vector space R^3 is 3 dimensional
- a vector space R^n can't be 'within' a vector space R^m ; n < m

sub-spaces :

- a single axis in a vector space is a sub-space (H) of that vector space (V)

- conditions to satisfy :

	- The zero vector of V is in H
	- For each u and v in H, u + v is in H 
	- For each u in H and each scalar c, cu is in H

- 4 possible sub spaces of a matrix A are useful to solve Ax = b :

	- column space of A
	- null space of A
	- left null space of A
	- row space of A

general :

- if 2 vectors can be expressed in the form c1v1 + c2v2 = 0 -> linearly dependent
- if making an A using 2 vectors gives 2 pivots -> linearly independent

- the columns of a square invertible matrix are always independent
- the columns of A are independent when N(A) = 0
- the r non zero rows of U or R are linearly independent
- The columns of a matrix A of order m x n with m < n are always dependent
- if any of the vectors in A are 0, then the vectors in A are linearly independent

spanning a subspace :

- if a vector space V  consists of all linear combinations of w1, w2, ... wk, then these vectors span the space
- u (in v) = c1w1 + c2w2 + ... + ckwk
- a set of vectors may be able to span a line or 2d plane as well (observe coordinate relation)

basis for a vector space :

- basis for V is a sequence of vectors having two properties at once 

	- few & linearly independent vectors
	- they span the same space

dimension of a vector space :

- dimension is just a number
- number of vectors in a basis
